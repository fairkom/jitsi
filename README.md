## Dev Instance:

- use nextcloud developer docker: https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev
- in repo folde make `composer install`, `npm install` and `npm run build`
- I used v28 because the nextcloud jitsi app is only available for stable28 (https://juliushaertl.github.io/nextcloud-docker-dev/), thats why look `pwd` in repo folder and change `~/path/to/appid` and `appid`, look also if other instances with different versions are still running

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e SERVER_BRANCH=v28.0.6 \
  -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/apps-extra/fairmeeting \
  ghcr.io/juliushaertl/nextcloud-dev-php80:latest
```

- than go to http://localhost:8080/index.php/settings/apps, login with u: admin pw: admin, and activate the 'fairmeeting Integration App'
